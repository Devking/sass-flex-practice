      <p>As the global center for research and thought leadership on the responsible and <strong>ethical</strong> creation, use and governance of technology in society, we leverage our multidisciplinary faculty, research, resources, and professional and community networks to collaborate with, and engage the university community, public institutions, public interest organizations, and community based organizations, to <i>significantly</i> impact the world’s current and future technology landscape. And here we test a <a href="#cont-prisons">link</a>.</p>
      <h1 id="cont-prisons">Are Prisons Obsolete?</h1>
      <p>In most parts of the world, it is taken for granted that who­ever is convicted of a serious crime will be sent to prison. In some countries-including the United States-where capital punishment has not yet been abolished, a small but signifi­cant number of people are sentenced to death for what are considered especially grave crimes. Many people are familiar with the campaign to abolish the death penalty. In fact, it has already  been abolished in  most  countries. Even  the staunchest advocates of capital punishment acknowledge the fact that the death penalty faces serious challenges. Few peo­ple find life without the death penalty difficult to imagine.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the prison is considered an inevitable and permanent feature of our social lives.  Most people are quite surprised to hear that the prison abolition movement also has a long history-one that dates back to the historical appearance of the prison as the main form of punishment. In fact, the most  natural reaction is  to  assume that prison activists-even those who consciously refer to themselves as "antiprison activists"-are  simply trying  to  ameliorate prison conditions or perhaps to reform the prison in more fundamental ways. In most circles prison abolition is simply unthinkable and  implausible. Prison abolitionists are dismissed as utopians and idealists whose ideas are at best unre­alistic and impracticable, and,  at worst, mystifying and fool­ish.  This is  a  measure of  how  difficult it is to  envision a social order that does not rely on the threat of sequestering people in  dreadful plaees designed to  separate them from their communities and families. The prison is considered so "natural" that it is extremely hard to imagine life without it.</p>
      <p>It  is  my  hope that  this book will  encourage readers to question their own assumptions about the prison. Many peo­ple have already reached the conclusion that the death penal­ty  is an  outmoded form of punishment that violates basic principles of human rights. It is time, I believe, to encourage similar conversations about the  prison. During my  own career as an antiprison activist I have seen the population of u.s. prisons increase with such rapidity that many people in black, Latino, and  Native American communities now have a far greater chance of going to prison than of getting a decent education. When many young people decide to join the mili­tary  service in  order to avoid the inevitability of  a  stint in prison, it should cause us to wonder whether we should not try to introduce better alternatives.</p>
      <p>The question of whether the prison has become an obso­lete institution has become especially urgent in light of the fact that more than two million people (out of a world total of nine million! now inhabit U.S. prisons, jails, youth facili­ties, and immigrant detention centers. Are we willing to rel­egate ever larger numbers of people from racially oppressed eommunities to an isolated existence marked by authoritari­an regimes, violence, disease,  and  technologies of  seclusion that produce severe mental instability? According to a recent study,  there may be  twice as  many people suffering from mental illness who are in jails and prisons than there are in all psychiatric hospitals in the United States combined.<sup>1</sup></p>
